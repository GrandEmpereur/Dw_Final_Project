      <h1>I'm Monkey D. Luffy <span id="type2"></span></h1>
      <p>
        Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters. His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger. 
        He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.</br>
        Luffy is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, the sworn brother of late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan.</br>
        He is one of the few people in the world that carry the Will of D.</br>
        Luffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors in the Grand Line; emerging victorious in a majority of these battles. </br>
        Luffy's accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element", earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters and even the World Government. </br>
        Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. </br>
        After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press has labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea", though many prominent figures consider this to be exaggerated.</br>
        These acts, among other things, have given him his current bounty of  1,500,000,000 berry. Having had a bounty of 300,000,000 berry  prior to his arrival at the Sabaody Archipelago, Luffy is one of eleven rookie pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties over 100,000,000 berry which was received from the situation in Alabasta, a group which would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation", with the addition of a twelfth.

        <h1>Summary of Alabasta Saga</h1>
        <p>
        The Straw Hat crew and Vivi finally arrive in the desert kingdom of Alabasta, intent on dismantling Baroque Works and destroying Crocodile's ambitions. In the first city, Luffy runs into Colonel Smoker, who had anticipated his movements, but easily gets out of this predicament thanks to his brother, Ace, whom he also meets by chance. While Crocodile puts the finishing touches to his plans to take over the kingdom, our heroes see the extent of the unrest that is spreading there: drought, rebellion and the threat of civil war. They decide to go directly to the privateer's lair, Rain Base, to confront him, but they are trapped (along with Smoker), and then Luffy is left for dead by Crocodile after a one-sided duel, unable to do anything against his opponent's logia powers. This fight will however allow him to understand the privateer's weak point.

The events triggered by all these adventures seem to end in one place: the capital of the kingdom, where the rebel army, the agents of Baroque Works and Luffy's crew converge. A bloody and epic battle between the rebels and the regular army on the one hand, and Baroque Works and our heroes on the other, leads to the defeat of Crocodile and his plans. Luffy also gains a new crew member, Nico Robin, who was an ally of the privateer under the name of Miss Allsunday, as well as a bounty of one hundred million berrys.

        <h1>Summary of Skypiea Saga </h1>
        <p>
        Thanks to the geyser and Montblanc Cricket, Luffy and his crew reach the White Sea and the heavenly islands of Skypiea. There they meet two local inhabitants, Conis and Pagaya, who introduce them to the local customs and objects, such as the "dials", a kind of shell with various properties, or the wavers that allow them to navigate on the sea of clouds. However, an altercation with the local militia makes them realise that all is not well in this world: the inhabitants are indeed ruled with an iron fist by a person who calls himself "god" - the latter possessing certain supernatural powers such as the mantra. Another problem is a warlike people called Shandia whose land (Upper Yard) has been stolen by the sky dwellers - the leader, Wiper, dreams of taking it back by force.

In this context, Luffy and his friends decide to go and confront this god, who is in fact called Ener, causing many fights between all the protagonists. In the end, Luffy manages to defeat Ener thanks to a definite advantage: his rubber body is totally insensitive to his opponent's lightning. The passage in these islands will also bring the explanation on the mysterious golden city and the legend of Norland, evoked by Montblanc Cricket in the arc Jaya.

        The Thriller Bark arc corresponds to the arrival of Luffy's crew in the Florian Triangle, a dangerous sea area covered in fog. After meeting Brook, a living skeleton, our heroes are trapped on Thriller Bark, the huge ship of the privateer Captain Gecko Moria with a gothic atmosphere. The crew comes across some very strange creatures such as zombies, a cerberus, etc. However, they discover what lies behind these supernatural phenomena: Moria and Hogback have the ability to bring bodies back to life by stealing people's shadows. The latter take advantage of Luffy's arrival to steal his shadow and bring back to life a giant named Oz.

After battling many zombies, the Straw Hat crew finally defeats Moria and recovers all the shadows he had stolen. However, it is at this point that another Privateer Captain appears: Bartolomew Kuma, causing new adventures. At the end of the arc, Brook will join the Luffy crew as a musician.

        There are only three hours left before Portgas D. Ace is executed by the Navy. Monkey D. Luffy, accompanied by the escapees from Impel Down (Jinbei, Crocodile, Ivankov, Baggy the clown ...) sails to Marinford to save him.
At the same time, on the platform where the execution will take place, Sengoku, the head of the Navy, makes an announcement, transmitted by visual den den muchi to the Shabondy Archipelago: Ace will be executed for being the son of Gol D. Roger, the Pirate Lord, and for being the commander of the second division of Whitebeard, the most powerful pirate currently sailing the seas.

Just after this announcement, 43 pirate ships allied to Whitebeard appeared on the horizon, followed a few moments later by him with 4 of his ships, including the Moby Dick. In order to make an entrance in the middle of the bay, all his ships have sailed under the sea so far.

Whitebeard reveals his powers to Marinford: he has eaten the Gura Gura fruit and can cause tremors. He uses his demon fruit on the sea to create a gigantic tsunami which is heading towards the Navy forces. Admiral Aokiji takes his seat at the bottom of the scaffold to freeze the waves, tens of meters high, as well as the entire bay of the Headquarters. He takes advantage of this to send spears of ice against Whitebeard, which break under the effect of the shaking power. Captain Mihawk intervenes in turn to test the Emperor's strength and sends him a great cutting attack that Joz, the commander of the 3rd division, manages to stop by turning his body into a diamond. Admiral Kizaru in turn leaves his seat under the execution platform to launch successive and extremely fast waves of lasers that Marco, the commander of the 1st division, blocks with his Phoenix power by spinning around in the air.

The navy and pirates then begin waves of attack and counter-attack, gradually revealing demon powers: one Whitebeard commander can store objects in his body, Vice Admiral Tsuru is able to leach and expand pirates, Vice Admiral Onigumo can transform into a Spider and another Vice Admiral into a Dalmatian.

Oars, the descendant of Oz, decides to charge Marinford's defences: he manages to fight his way through the marines, manages to defeat the giant Vice Admiral Lacroix and gets dangerously close to the execution platform. The marines respond with a concentration of cannon and rifle fire on his huge body in an attempt to stop him. The Corsair Captains then decide to intervene and quickly stop Oars' momentum: Kuma stops his run with the Bear Shock, Doflamingo then slices his right leg and finally Moria pierces him with a shadow spear. Oars then collapses a few steps away from Ace.

        <h1>Summary of Island of the Fishmen Saga </h1>
        <p>
          
After diving, Luffy and his crew are attacked by Caribou and his crew, and are easily captured. They then come face to face with a kraken that blocks their way to Fishman Island, which Luffy offers to train to keep him safe. Caribou gives Sandi, Zorro and Luffy bubble-shells. The three show their progress and easily defeat the kraken. They get sucked into a column of water that takes them to -7000 metres, separating them from the ship.

The rest of the crew is attacked by sea monsters and Vander Decken's crew. The two crews have to flee because of an underwater volcano and arrive at the island of the fish men. Immediately, a group of fish-men riding sea kings offer them an alliance, an alliance that Luffy refuses. Our heroes flee, then arrive in the island of the fish-men and are separated again. Luffy, Sandi, Pipo and Chopper are rescued by Camie, but Sandi is bleeding from the excitement of the mermaids.

They are attacked by a group of fishmen who try to capture them, but Luffy beats them up. They are guided by Camie to a bar where Sandi gets her blood back from pirates, and where Lady Shirley, a seer who predicts that Luffy will destroy the fish-man island, is located. Then Camie and the others, after finding Nami and Brook, are invited by King Neptune into his palace. Luffy, attracted by the smell of food, enters the princess' room (which has been locked up for 10 years) and convinces her to go outside for a walk. Pipo, Nami, Brook and Zorro (who were already in the palace) are attacked by the soldiers because of Lady Shirley's prediction and take them and the king as hostages. Hodi and Vander Decken, who have made an alliance, storm the palace.

Zorro makes sure that the hostages can escape and cuts off Hodi with one blow. Hodi's subordinates refuel with a drug and give one to Hodi to recover, he then grabs Neptune with one hand as he flees and prevents him from leaving. With Luffy finding Sandy and Chopper, the group gets tied up by the citizens, Vander Decken goes after Princess Shirahoshi but gets beaten by Luffy. Then the straw hat group and the princess go to the underwater forest where they find Franky and Dan (Tom's brother), as well as Camie and Nami who managed to escape. Jimbei then tells the people present about the past of the island of the fishmen. Following Jimbei's revelations, the whole crew set off towards the main square of the island to put an end to Hodi and his crew. After a Dantean fight where Luffy was seriously injured, he managed to defeat Hodi Jones.
